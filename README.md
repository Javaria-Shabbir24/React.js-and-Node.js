# React.js and Node.js

## Description
This repository provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform various file operations involving HTML files using Node.js and the `fs` module. Each task demonstrates a specific functionality required to manage HTML files programmatically, including reading, creating, updating, deleting, and renaming HTML files.

## Tasks Overview

### Reading Files
1. **Read Single HTML File:**
   - Write a Node.js script that reads the contents of an HTML file named `index.html` asynchronously using the `fs` module and prints it to the console.

2. **Read Multiple HTML Files:**
   - Implement a Node.js program that reads all HTML files in a directory named `html_files` and logs the number of `<img>` tags found in each file.

### Creating Files
1. **Create Basic HTML File:**
   - Create a Node.js script that generates a new HTML file named `new_page.html` with a basic structure including `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, and saves it to the current directory using the `fs` module.

2. **Create Multiple HTML Files:**
   - Write a Node.js program that creates multiple HTML files dynamically based on user input, where each file contains different content, such as titles, paragraphs, and images.

### Updating Files
1. **Update HTML File Content:**
   - Write a Node.js program that updates the content of an HTML file named `about.html` by replacing occurrences of a specific keyword with a user-provided replacement string.

### Deleting Files
1. **Delete HTML File:**
   - Create a Node.js script that deletes an HTML file named `obsolete_page.html` from the file system using the `fs` module.

### Renaming Files
1. **Rename Single HTML File:**
   - Write a Node.js program that renames an existing HTML file named `old_page.html` to `new_page.html` using the `fs` module.

2. **Rename Multiple HTML Files:**
   - Implement a Node.js script that renames multiple HTML files in a directory named `html_backup` by adding a timestamp to their filenames to indicate when they were backed up.
